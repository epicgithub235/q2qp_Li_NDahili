                BACKGROUND OF PHILIPPINE RED CROSS
            </h1>
            <p>
                Born officially in 1947, but with roots that traces back to the revolutionary days, 
                the Philippine Red Cross has truly become the premier humanitarian organization in the 
                country, committed to provide quality life-saving services that protect the life and 
                dignity especially of indigent Filipinos in vulnerable situations.

                WHAT HAVE WE DONE SO FAR
            </h1>
            <p>
                In all its 74 years of reputable existence, the Philippine Red Cross has lived through many 
                changes that were intended to help more people. Where it used to be involved only in providing 
                blood and in disaster-related activities, the Philippine Red Cross now focuses on a holistic 
                approach to uplift the condition of the most vulnerable. Where it used to offer short-term 
                palliatives, it now offers a wider array of humanitarian services ranging from preventive 
                medicine to therapeutic counseling, to youth leadership.
